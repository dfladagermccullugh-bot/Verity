# Verity

A constrained-interview tool that turns a vague idea into a structured PRD. The invitee answers nothing but **yes**, **no**, or **done** — the model carries the burden of asking.

Live: invite-only. See *Try it* below.

## The problem

Most AI brainstorming tools hand the user a blank text box and ask them to type. That works for people who already know what they want to build. For everyone else — a stakeholder with a half-formed idea, a designer who can describe a feeling but not a spec, a founder mid-shower-thought — the blank box is the bottleneck. Typing is slow, typing forces premature commitment, and a long-form answer to a vague prompt usually produces a long-form mess.

The interesting question is not "how do we get better answers from the user?" It is "how little do we need from the user to extract a coherent product brief?"

## The approach

Verity reduces the user's surface area to three buttons. The model is required to ask exactly one yes/no question per turn, and the system rejects any output that isn't a single, jargon-free, single-sentence question. When the model decides it has enough signal, it emits a PRD in markdown and the session ends.

Two design bets sit underneath that:

1. **Constraint as interface.** A yes/no answer is roughly one bit of information, but a *well-targeted* yes/no answer from the right branch of a decision tree is worth a paragraph of vague prose. The model's job is to pick the right next question; the user's job is to react. The interaction is faster, lower-stakes, and surprisingly more honest — people commit to opinions they would have hedged on in writing.

2. **Hard guardrails, not soft prompting.** The system prompt asks for good behavior; the [output guard](src/lib/guard.ts) enforces it. Multi-line output, batched questions, technology jargon, and missing question marks all fail the guard, trigger a regeneration, and — on a second failure — force the model into the PRD-write path. The model is never trusted to follow format rules on its own.

PRD markdown emailed to operator + stored
```

**Flow.** An admin creates a single-use invite. The invitee opens the link, writes one seed sentence, then answers yes/no questions one at a time until the model has enough to write the PRD — or until they tap *I'm done*. The PRD is generated, persisted, and emailed.

**Key files.**
- [src/lib/interview-engine.ts](src/lib/interview-engine.ts) — turn loop, retry policy, runaway ceiling, PRD-forcing fallback
- [src/lib/guard.ts](src/lib/guard.ts) — output classifier; the only thing standing between the model and the user
- [src/lib/skill/idea-seeding-agent.md](src/lib/skill/idea-seeding-agent.md) — the system prompt, bundled into the build so it ships with the serverless function rather than being read from disk at runtime
- [src/app/i/[token]/q/interview.tsx](src/app/i/[token]/q/interview.tsx) — the client-side card that masks model latency with optimistic animation and a cycling loading word

**Failure modes I cared about.**
- *Model misbehaves on format.* The guard rejects and the engine regenerates once; a second reject forces the stop-confirm path so the session never dead-ends.
- *Model never stops asking.* A hard ceiling at 40 turns short-circuits to PRD generation.
- *Model refuses to write the PRD.* The forcer appends an increasingly explicit instruction and accepts a best-effort markdown blob on the last attempt — the operator always gets something to read.
- *Latency feels dead.* Optimistic card transitions and a cycling word make the wait feel like motion rather than a stall.

## Stack

- **Next.js 14** App Router, React 18, TypeScript, server actions for the interview loop
- **Postgres** via Drizzle ORM; schema in [src/lib/db/schema.ts](src/lib/db/schema.ts) (invites, sessions, turns)
- **Anthropic SDK** for model calls
- **iron-session** for admin auth, **Resend** for transactional email
- **Tailwind** with a Material 3 token layer; **Framer Motion** for the interview card
- Deployed on Vercel

## Why I built it

I wanted to test whether the right interaction model could make an LLM useful for people who do not write well-formed prompts. The yes/no constraint started as a joke and turned out to be the thing the product is about: it shifts the work of articulation from the user to the model, where it should have been the whole time.

It is also a forcing function for me. Every design decision — guard rules, retry policy, latency masking, the choice to bundle the system prompt at build time — comes from a question the constraint surfaced.

## Try it

Verity is invite-only by design (single-use tokens, no public signup). If you want to walk through it, reach out and I will issue you a token.

## Running locally

```
cp .env.example .env.local      # fill in Postgres URL, Anthropic key, Resend key, session secret
npm install
npm run db:migrate
npm run dev
```

Tests: `npm test`. Type-check: `npm run typecheck`.
